                <h2>Comp Sci 201</h2>
                <p>This class was fun to take as I liked the HTML and CSS part where we learned to make beginner sites. I struggled with the javascript as I feel like there are just to many functions that can be used so I get lost and don't know where to start, but I do enjoy the class as it teaches me new things.</p>
                <h2>Eng 212</h2>
                <p>My Creative writting classes is a really easy going class. I like this class as it promoted me to speak more and that helps me alot. I am usally an introvert who doesn't really talk much but this class kind of forces me to get out of that habbit.</p>
                <h2>Hum Bio 217</h2>
                <p>Human Disease and Society was an intresting class. I initelly thought it was a class that will talk only about different kinds of diseases. This class did talk about diseases but it goes more into different cells that causes these disease and and what part of our immune system will be affected if we were to contract these diseases.</p>
                <h2>ET 198</h2>
                <p>My first year seminar class. I didn't need to take a first year seminar class, but I wanted to learn more about the college and the different resources it can provide me so I decided to take this class. This class taught me about sustainability, although it doesn't fill that sustainability GenEd.</p>
